# Designing a Database for PAWsitive Dog Care
**I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**  
	A new company, PAWsitive Dog Daycare is seeking a database for its dog daycare center that offers boarding, grooming and training. The company wants a database that keeps track of their employees’ schedules and customers’ bookings information. The database must go through a formal database design lifecycle to be in at least third normal form. This report describes the process of going through the database design lifecycle to create the database, the detailed design of the database, and the final product/release version of the database and UI.  
	Based on the company’s intended use for the database, the end result to access the database will be a web application that anyone can access through the URL. We designed a database that met the needs of the company and provided them with a usable web application. The initial implementation of the database can be done one time by the database designers but once the website is launched all future data can be input through the website.
